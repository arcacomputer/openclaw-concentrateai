# Provenance and exact timestamps

## Campaign and original source reconciliation

The [final 2026-09-16 campaign](TEST-CAMPAIGN-2026-09-16.md) identifies its exact tested source and artifact digest, retains every recorded attempt, and distinguishes evidence timestamps from publication. Main incorporates that tested implementation with its original Git history. Runtime/package bytes were compared with the retained installed artifact; later documentation edits mean a newly packed archive would have a different digest. No new registry publication or fresh live campaign is implied.

See [what changed](../CHANGELOG.md) and [methodology](TESTING.md). The earlier in-flight report remains in Git history at `0f849237d24751dcc311a9dd0ab0c5a2f562b8e4`.

Later correctness changes are recorded in the [precision review](PRECISION-REVIEW-2026-09-16.md) with their own [proof](precision-proof-2026-09-16.json). Historical source/file hashes are not relabeled to describe the changed candidate.

## Historical publication record

- Author timestamp: **`2026-09-13T00:44:35+00:00`**
- Committer timestamp: **`2026-09-13T00:44:35+00:00`**
- Parent commit: `f984c1e9f10a7a111e136f446261de36fa98ea60`
- Full machine-readable record: [provenance.json](provenance.json).

These timestamps are explicitly applied to the commit adding this record, not inferred from file modification times. Resolve that commit's full SHA with:

```sh
git log -1 --format='%H%nAuthor: %aI%nCommitter: %cI' -- docs/provenance.json
```

## Prior publications

[Exact commit history](COMMIT-HISTORY.md) includes commit links, full SHAs, author times and committer times. [JSON export](commit-history.json) names its exact coverage boundary. Git itself stores exact metadata for every subsequent commit; an export cannot contain its own final commit hash without changing that hash.

## Testing versus publication

The compatibility snapshot is **2026-09-13 resume-06**, published separately from the underlying test runs. Its SHA-256 is `a329693e77bfd8dbabde56a3a4b23131a8d81de60714e7e4ebfa87d34e775052`. Publishing a report does not imply the tests ran at the commit time. This snapshot does not carry an exact test-completion timestamp; none is invented here. Live tests, synthetic tests and model-discovery metadata remain distinct in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Updating the record

Run `python3 scripts/export-provenance.py` before each publication to refresh the history through the current HEAD. The script reads Git only and never edits author dates or rewrites existing commits. Preserve original evidence timestamps when adding future test reports. Do not substitute file mtimes or publication dates for execution timestamps.
